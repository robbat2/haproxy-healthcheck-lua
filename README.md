# agent-check of HAProxy
This code & HAProxy example configuration provides a way to expose the health
of HAProxy itself.

It should NOT be confused with the agent-check functionality that HAProxy can
use to check backend servers.

The output is formatted to be similar to the agent-check TCP check used by
HAProxy, but sent via HTTP rather than TCP.

The exampe configuration uses two files which can be used to set the output
into `MAINT` or `DRAIN` states. The files are `haproxy_maint.acl`,
`haproxy_drain.acl` respectively.

One example usage might be checking the state of HAProxy from a seperate L4
load balancer layer [#L4LB]. 
- If HAProxy is up AND ready, new connections should be delivered to HAProxy. 
- If HAProxy is up, but going down soon, no new connections should be accepted,
  but it may be desirable to let long-running connections continue (e.g.
  in-flight uploads/downloads)

Beware that if you naively connect the `DOWN`/`DRAIN`/`MAINT` states to some
BGP announcement, but have in-flight active connections, the BGP route being
withdrawn may then cause the connections to break.

## TODO:
- Implement `weight` output
- Implement `maxconn` output
